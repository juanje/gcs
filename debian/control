Description: Guadalinex Configuration System
 gcs (Guadalinex Configuration System) is a system which was originally created
 to generate plane metapackages (just dependences) and configuration 
 metapackages (which add or change other packages' configurations in the best 
 Debian package way possible).
 .
 The system uses a very simple skeleton of files.
 Although it was designed for creating and maintaining metapackages, it's
 possible to create a Debian package for a new project very easy and then keep
 working with the Debian package source.
